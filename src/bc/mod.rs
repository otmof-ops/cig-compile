//! Stage B's lowering (#31): a verified CIR module to the register
//! bytecode the cig runtime's VM runs (`docs/BYTECODE.md` in cig-script is
//! the contract), for the language the VM runs today: constants, slots
//! and moves; arithmetic, comparison and logic; `if`, `while`, `for`,
//! `break`, `continue`; pulls and lambdas, closures that capture (cells),
//! calls by name, by value, to builtins and to methods, `snuff`; lists,
//! maps, members, indexes and their stores; interpolation and `exhale`;
//! `try`/`ashtray`/`finally` and `cough`; a prelude name used as a value
//! (`loadg`); burns, their ops and compensations; `pack`; chains; step
//! marks.
//!
//! A program lowers completely or is refused: the one construct the
//! bytecode cannot carry, a `pack` root that runs a pull or a function,
//! stops the lowering with [`Error::Refused`], which names it and its
//! span. Every module that leaves is verified by the format crate's
//! verifier; one that does not verify is [`Error::Internal`], a bug here.
//!
//! How each piece reads:
//! - a slot (`roll`, `stick`, a parameter) is one register for the whole
//!   function; a CIR value is a register from its definition to its last
//!   use, then the register is free again. A value defined before a loop
//!   and read inside it lives to the loop's end. A read of a slot no closure captures is the slot's register, with
//!   no copy, and a value stored into such a slot right after it is made
//!   is made in the slot's register, where that is exact (`plan`);
//! - a call's callee and arguments are moved into a fresh window of
//!   consecutive registers (`call A, B, 0`, `callb A, idx, n`); a pull
//!   called by name has its closure read straight into the window;
//! - a constant operand is the instruction's `K` (`addk` ... `lek`);
//! - `a > b` is `le a, b` then `not`, `a >= b` is `lt a, b` then `not`,
//!   `a != b` is `eq` then `not`: the operands keep their order, so the
//!   interpreter's error wording does too. A comparison only a branch
//!   reads is the branch's fused jump, with the same operator on the
//!   same operands (`compare_jump`);
//! - a step mark is `steps k, 1` (k the loop nesting where it sits), a
//!   loop starts with `steps k, 0` before its condition and ends with
//!   `steps k-1, 0`, where `break` lands, folded into the next
//!   statement's mark when that follows at once. The iteration's tick is
//!   the body's own first mark, after the condition's test;
//! - a captured slot's register carries a cell, fresh each time its
//!   block runs, in a register nothing else uses;
//! - a `try` is `try.enter`, the body (the handler's range), the catch
//!   and the finally, each ending with `try.leave 0`; `break`, `continue`
//!   and `snuff` leave each `try` they cross first (`try.leave 1` for one
//!   whose finally they leave), a snuffed value waiting in a register no
//!   finally writes. No tail call is emitted, so none sits in a try;
//! - a burn is the state map, `burn.enter`, `comp.enter` (with an
//!   `unburn`), the body, `comp.leave`, `burn.leave`, with its region and
//!   the region's row. A string literal label is the region's constant;
//!   any other is the region's register, the label's value, evaluated
//!   before the state map, with a `nop` after `burn.enter` at the label's
//!   position. `break` and `continue` leave every try and burn they cross,
//!   innermost first, then jump, with nothing after the jump; `snuff`
//!   leaves only the tries (its `ret` closes the burns, and a `try.leave`
//!   the burns inside its try). A body that ends in one of those (or in
//!   `cough`) ends the row there, with no closing pair no run reaches. A
//!   `burn.op` outside every burn of its function marks the function
//!   `requires_burn`;
//! - the top level's `chain` statements are `chain.make` with `C = 1`, and
//!   its one normal end returns a map of every name its statements
//!   declare, so a run can answer `--light` as the tree-walker does;
//! - each `pack` root and chain step but the last is checked where the
//!   tree-walker checks it, right after it is evaluated: one that fails
//!   goes straight to `pack` or `chain.make`, which raises its error;
//! - an index read or store, and a compound member store, check their
//!   operands' types first (`type_of`) so each error is raised at the
//!   position the tree-walker gives it;
//! - every instruction gets the span of the CIR instruction it came from,
//!   and the line table keeps a row wherever the span changes from the
//!   instruction before it.
