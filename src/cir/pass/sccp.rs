//! `sccp`: the arm of an `if` that a constant condition never takes is
//! emptied.

use super::Pass;
use crate::cir::ir::*;
use std::collections::HashMap;

/// Sparse conditional constant propagation, in the form CIR's structured
/// control flow needs: `fold-consts`, run before it, carries the constants,
/// and this pass empties the dead side of an `if` whose condition is a
/// known boolean constant. The lattice through phis comes with stage B's
/// SSA, if it has phis. The `if` itself
/// stays, so the places of every surviving pinned instruction do too
/// (T1); the cond's own instruction stays, so a condition that might have
/// raised still raises at its own span. The emptied arm goes whole, its
/// step marks and its operations that may raise with it: the verifier
/// sees the constant condition and lets a block that never runs go (T3,
/// T4).
///
/// Must not: remove a branch whose condition can raise (the branch
/// instruction stays), drop a `burn.op` (T3 would catch it) or move one
/// out of a region. The dead side is left alone when it carries a
/// `burn.op`, a `burn`, a `closure`, a `pack` or a chain declaration: all
/// visible in the module beyond this block, so their removal is a bigger
/// change than this pass performs at stage A.
